# NLP sklearn
A diagnostic analysis of Machine Learning topics from NIPS papers data using LDA and GridSearch from sklearn.

Data taken from kaggle.com.

In this notebook, I use the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and GridSearch from python's sklearn library to analyze machine learning topics in the NIPS papers dataset. I also use python's LDA visualization tools to display the topics drawn from the best LDA model.
