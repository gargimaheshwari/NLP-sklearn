# NLP sklearn
A diagnostic analysis of Machine Learning topics from NIPS papers data using LDA and GridSearch from sklearn.

Data taken from kaggle.com. The file is too big to upload here. Find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/nips-papers) under papers.csv.

In this notebook, I use the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and GridSearch from python's sklearn library to analyze machine learning topics in the NIPS papers dataset. I also use python's LDA visualization tools to display the topics drawn from the best LDA model.
